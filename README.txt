This source-code is an extension to the general solution to the Lab# 2 --"Quest" in the Head First C# book.
The original classes provided by the book have been left there as a reference only. Those classes are not used
as the game was extended to include a variety of features and explore the way those features could work.
My primary idea was to give more functionalities and flexibility to the original game. I tried to make it more vivid,
learn and have fun while doing it. I am sharing my code so those who are reading the book and want to try to
make it more flexible have a reference in case they have any problems while trying to do it.
